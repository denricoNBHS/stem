# Complete each task listed below and then push your solutions to your github repository.

# 1.  Import the module called school


# 2. Use list indexing to store the last element of schedule as last_period
schedule = ["Algebra", "Physics", "Study Hall", "English", "Arabic", "Lunch", "World History", "Physical Education"]

# 3. Use a list slice to store a list of the classes before lunch. Give this slice the name pre_lunch  

# 4. Use a list comprehension to generate a list of all courses in the schedule starting with the letter 'A'
#    and call it a_courses

# 5. The print_schedule function in the school module you imported earlier has two formal parameters:
# a name (string) and a schedule (list). You may look at the function in school.py if you'd like.
# Call the print_schedule function school.print_schedule, giving it your name and the schedule you generated earlier.
# Write the output of the function to the file "my_schedule.txt"
